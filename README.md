- Difference: `9 - 10`
- Multiplication: `9 \* 10`
- Integer Division: `9 / 10`
- Float Division: `9 // 10`
- Exponents (e.g. 9^10): `bigspender(9, 10)`
- Modulus: `9 % 10`

## Control Flow

### If Statements

<table>
<tr> <th>JavaScript</th><th>PokerScript</th><tr>
</tr>

<td>

```javascript
if (x == 0) {
  return true;
  
} else {
  return false;
}
```

</td>
<td>

```
excuses x == 0 $.
  cashout hit
  
.$ noMoreExcuses $.
  cashout miss
.$
```

</td>
</table>

### While, Do-While loops

<table>
<tr> <th>JavaScript</th><th>PokerScript</th><tr>
</tr>

<td>

```javascript
let patience = 3;
while (patience != 0) {
  console.log("What is taking so long!?");
  patience--;
}
```

</td>

<td>

```
chip patience: 3
contemplating patience != 0  $.
  reveal "What is taking so long!?"
  patience -$
.$
```

</td>
</table>

### For-Loops

- For loops in PokerScript must have two or three statements within them.

<table>
<tr> <th>JavaScript</th><th>PokerScript</th><tr>
</tr>

<td>

```javascript
let winnings = 0
for (int x = 0; x < 10; x++) {
  for (int y = 0; y < 20; y++) {
    winnings += 5;
  }
}
```

</td>

<td>

```
chip winnings: 0
playingLoose (chip x: 0, x < 10, x+$) $.
  playingLoose (chip y: 0, y < 20, y+$) $.
    winnings +$ 5
  .$
.$
```

</td>
</table>

## Comments

In Poker, it's rude to comment on the way people play. Hence,
Single line comments are marked with `rude` and multiline comments are marked with `rude/` at the beginning and `/rude` at the end.

```

rude this is a single line comment

rude/
this is a multiline comment
/rude

```
