# Simple variable declaration

make x with 1;
make y with "Make variables with ANY type!";
make z with ["even", "a", "list"];
constantly make C with "constants cannot be changed";

# and even simpler incrementation

add 1 to x;
subtract 1 from x;
multiply x by 1;
divide x by 1;

# Say goodbye to those confusing math symbols!

change x to 5;
make a with 2 plus x minus 7;
make b with 2 to the 9 minus (10 divided by x) times x to the 0;
# let b = (2 ^ (9 - ((10 / x) * (x ^ 0))));
